I came across with Data Science trough a friend which was studying a one year course in Dublin during the same time i was studying industrial automation. After i've finished my degree i've curious about knowing this Data Science stuff that everyone was talking about and i started slowly to reading and studying the basics od Big Data and Data Science. And what started as an hobbie soon became a daily habbit trying to learn a little bit everyday. 

Learning 1% per day it will be 30% a month and 365% a year.


**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Space Operations and Mathematical Optimisation.

Still working on the first one...i will have news soon 

Datalogger Poroject - Working on a project for the company where i work, i am trying to build an aplication where we can know the price for for loaning temperatura dataloggers trough the number of days and number of loggers. In my company we do not have a fixed price for this problem and there are so many possibilities, and as i deal with this problem several times i have decided to create a solution... lets see if i can get my limited data science knowledge to resolve this problem.
