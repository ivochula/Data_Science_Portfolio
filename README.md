I came across with Data Science through a friend which was studying a one year Data Science course in Dublin during the same time i was studying industrial automation. After i've finished my degree i've became curious about knowing this Data Science stuff that everyone was talking about and i started slowly reading and studying the basics of Big Data and Data Science. And what started as an hobby soon became a daily habbit trying to learn a little bit everyday. 

Learning 1% per day it will be 30% a month and 365% a year.


**Background in:** C Ansi, C#, Python, R, Azure Machine Learning.

## Projects:

**Datalogger Project -** I have built an aplication where is possible to calculate the price for loaning/renting temperature dataloggers inputing the number of days and number of loggers. In my company we do not have a fixed price for this problem and there are so many possibilities of prices even if there are only two variables, and i deal with this problem several times, so i have decided to create this app to help me and my coworkers. Supervised learning / Regression problem.

Deployed Model through Heroku

**Training Datasets**

Titanic - Everyone starts here, right?!?! - Started with some exploratory analysis, trying to find the rates of survival for the different classes and ages. Replaced missing values, feature engineering, model creation and otimization.

Cancer Death Rate - Many aspects of the behaviour of cancer disease are highly unpredictable. Even with the huge number of studies that have been done on the DNA mutation responsible for the disease, we are still unable to use these information at clinical level. However, it is important that we understand the effects and impacts of this disease from the past information as much as we possibly can. This was an application for a Datathon competition on DPhi website.

https://dphi.tech/practice/challenge/52 - 12th place in the Datathon of DPhi website

TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge - This presents as a challenge, until now i have already used the package ROSE in R language to create synthetic data in order to have a balanced dataset to train my classification model... the work goes on, step by step, enjoying it without pressure.
